This repository consists of an R markdown file (EF reproductive senescence.Rmd) containing the code for the statistical analyses and graphs found in the above-mentioned scientific paper, the R project, and the datasets used (in .csv format). 

Description of datasets found in the folder:

 - EFrepSEN.csv is the dataset containing reproductive data from the individuals of exact known age monitored, this is, complete life-history data. This dataset was used for the offspring number models as specificied in the R markdown file.
 - EFlrs.csv is the dataset containing lifetime reproductive success from females and males of known age, and thus used for the LRS models as specified in the R markdown file.
 - fmMEANSd.csv and fmMEANS.csv are two datasets used for the combined male and female graph on delta and average age respectively, as specified in the R markdown file.
